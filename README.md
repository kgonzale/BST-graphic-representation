# Binary Search Tree 
###### This project was to display the graphical representation using JavaFX and Graphical User Interface (GUI) of Binary Search Trees. By using JavaFX, we were able to allow the client to press on buttons to become more interactive with a GUI. 

The buttons include:
* Introduction to BST
* Deleting/Inserting
* Traverals
* Tree Rotations
* Tree Balancing
